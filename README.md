Dear Kaisho,
I want to start this letter with a sincere apology. I know I haven’t been showing up the way I should have for our group project, and I’ve let you down. While I’ve been caught up in other things — partying, org responsibilities, and distractions — that’s no excuse. You’ve been holding it down while I drifted, and that’s not fair to you, or to what we’re building together.
I’ve been thinking a lot about how I’ve made you feel — maybe disappointed, maybe even hurt — and that breaks my heart. I love you, Kaisho. Not just as a friend, but as someone who means the world to me. You’ve always been someone I look up to: grounded, committed, and passionate. You deserve a partner who shows up with the same energy, and I haven't been that person lately.
I take full responsibility for dropping the ball, and I want to be better — not just say it, but prove it. I’m locking in now. No more excuses, no more half-commitments. I’m going to pull my weight and make sure you see the difference. You deserve to feel supported and valued, and I’m going to make sure my actions reflect how much this project — and you — mean to me.
Thank you for your patience, even when I didn’t deserve it. Thank you for being Kaisho — steady, creative, and powerful. I'm grateful for you, and I won't take you for granted again.
With all my love,
Thaeron
